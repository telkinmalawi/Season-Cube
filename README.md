# Season Cube

Season Cube is a cube designed by Tevin Fairclough that displays all four seasons along with a weather condition. The sketch shows the inside of the cube allows the viewer to look around and see the different seasons and pressing a key to interacting with these seasons. As technology gets more advanced we begin to loose out touch with nature and it is important we try to appreciate that as much as we can by trying to integrate it in our interactions with technology. This way we can de-stress and also not have connecting with nature become an inconvenience. 

Inspiration: 
Nam June Paik was an inspritation for this project . Tevin saw a work of his while visitng the Whitney was was inpressed with the apparition of a flower that formed on the screen witht he placement of a magnet. Nam June Paik had manipulated the electro magnetic rays to create this flower and it dawned on Tevin that this would make great home decore. Therefore Tevin decided to take this idea a step furthur and create a rendition of four whole seasons in processing.

Processing: 
I basically created the individual sides the cube first and joins to together as diffrent side or "textures" of the cube. I increased the Zposition to bring the cube closer and closer to me until I was on the inside. Then I added small little objects that were respective of their seasons. These objects display with the help of if functions.
